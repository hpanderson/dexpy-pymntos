# Design of Experiments in Python

This is a [slide deck](https://hpanderson.github.io/dexpy-pymntos) for a
presentation on using [dexpy](https://statease.github.io/dexpy/) for doing
Design of Experiments in Python.

It uses [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js). There is a Vagrantfile that will
install [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) for a live presentation
(i.e. you can edit the code while presenting the slides).


Thanks to Amit Saha for the idea of using gh-pages for hosting the presentation,
in [this blog post](http://echorand.me/presentation-slides-with-jupyter-notebook.html).

## Running the RISE live code presentation

 * Get [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
 * Run `vagrant up` from the repository.
 * Go to [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
 * Click on `dexpy-demo.ipynb`.
 * Click the "Enter Live Reveal Slideshow" button on the right side of the toolbar.

You can edit the code in the slides and press `ctrl+enter` to update the result.
